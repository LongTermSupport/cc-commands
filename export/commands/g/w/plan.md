# Plan Generator - Create Project Plans Following Best Practices

You are an expert project planner and software architect with deep knowledge of task organization, requirements analysis, and project documentation. Your approach prioritizes clarity, thoroughness, and actionable planning that follows the two-mode workflow: Planning Mode (research only, NO CODE CHANGES) and Execution Mode (implementation).

**CRITICAL: If any bash command fails or returns an error, you MUST immediately stop execution and abort the command. Do not attempt to continue, work around, or fix the error. Simply state "Command aborted due to bash error" and stop.**

**CRITICAL: Never use interactive bash commands like `read -p`, `read`, or any command that waits for stdin input. These will hang the command. Use Task blocks to handle user interaction instead.**

## 📖 Help Documentation

<Task>
If the user requested --help, provide the help documentation and exit.
</Task>

If you see `--help` in the arguments, please provide this help text and stop:

 PLAN GENERATOR - Two-Mode Planning Workflow
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Creates structured project plans following the two-mode workflow:
  • Planning Mode: Research and documentation only (NO CODE CHANGES)
  • Execution Mode: Implementation (requires explicit approval)

USAGE:
  /g:w:plan [task-name]
  /g:w:plan --help

ARGUMENTS:
  [task-name]    Name/description of the task to plan
  --help         Show this help message

EXAMPLES:
  /g:w:plan implement user authentication
    Creates a plan for implementing user authentication

  /g:w:plan refactor database connection layer
    Creates a plan for refactoring the database layer

WORKFLOW:
  1. Checks for project-specific planning workflow (CLAUDE/PlanWorkflow.md)
  2. Uses project workflow if found, otherwise uses embedded template
  3. Gathers detailed requirements through interactive prompts
  4. Researches relevant files and documentation
  5. Creates comprehensive plan in CLAUDE/Plan/[task-name].md

PLAN STRUCTURE:
  • Progress tracking with [ ], [⏳], [✓] symbols
  • Summary of the task goals
  • Detailed implementation steps
  • Code snippets for key changes
  • References to relevant documentation

MODES:
  Planning Mode (default):
    - Full research of files/database tables
    - Detailed plan of required actions
    - Code snippets for relevant items
    - NO CODE CHANGES

  Execution Mode (requires approval):
    - Implements the approved plan
    - Updates progress tracking
    - Makes actual code changes
```

## 📊 Argument Parsing

<Task>
Parse all arguments at once and output structured data for use throughout the command.
</Task>

!echo "=== ARGUMENT PARSING ==="; \
# First check for --help \
if [ "$ARGUMENTS" = "--help" ]; then \
  echo "HELP_REQUESTED: true"; \
  exit 0; \
fi; \
# Parse task name from arguments \
if [ -n "$ARGUMENTS" ]; then \
  # Use entire arguments as task name \
  TASK_NAME="$ARGUMENTS"; \
  # Convert to kebab-case for filename \
  FILENAME=$(echo "$TASK_NAME" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed 's/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/-/g' | sed 's/--*/-/g' | sed 's/^-//;s/-$//'); \
  echo "TASK_NAME: \"$TASK_NAME\""; \
  echo "FILENAME: \"$FILENAME\""; \
else \
  echo "TASK_NAME: \"\""; \
  echo "FILENAME: \"\""; \
fi

## 🚦 Precondition Checks

### Workflow Documentation Discovery
!echo "Discovering project planning workflow"; \
set -e; echo "=== Workflow Documentation Check ==="; \
# Check multiple possible locations for planning workflow \
WORKFLOW_FOUND=false; \
WORKFLOW_PATH=""; \
PROJECT_ROOT=$(pwd); \
if [ -f "CLAUDE/PlanWorkflow.md" ]; then \
  echo "✓ Found project workflow at CLAUDE/PlanWorkflow.md"; \
  WORKFLOW_FOUND=true; \
  WORKFLOW_PATH="CLAUDE/PlanWorkflow.md"; \
elif [ -f ".claude/PlanWorkflow.md" ]; then \
  echo "✓ Found project workflow at .claude/PlanWorkflow.md"; \
  WORKFLOW_FOUND=true; \
  WORKFLOW_PATH=".claude/PlanWorkflow.md"; \
elif [ -f "docs/planning-workflow.md" ]; then \
  echo "✓ Found project workflow at docs/planning-workflow.md"; \
  WORKFLOW_FOUND=true; \
  WORKFLOW_PATH="docs/planning-workflow.md"; \
else \
  echo "✗ No project-specific planning workflow found"; \
  echo "  Will use embedded generic planning template"; \
fi; \
echo "WORKFLOW_FOUND: $WORKFLOW_FOUND"; \
echo "WORKFLOW_PATH: \"$WORKFLOW_PATH\""; \
echo "PROJECT_ROOT: \"$PROJECT_ROOT\""; \
# Check for existing CLAUDE documentation \
echo ""; \
echo "=== Project Documentation Discovery ==="; \
DOCS_TO_REFERENCE=""; \
if [ -d "CLAUDE" ]; then \
  echo "✓ CLAUDE directory exists"; \
  # Build list of documentation to reference \
  if [ -f "CLAUDE/PlanWorkflow.md" ]; then DOCS_TO_REFERENCE="$DOCS_TO_REFERENCE- @CLAUDE/PlanWorkflow.md\n"; fi; \
  if [ -f "CLAUDE/Core/CodeStandards.md" ]; then DOCS_TO_REFERENCE="$DOCS_TO_REFERENCE- @CLAUDE/Core/CodeStandards.md\n"; fi; \
  if [ -f "CLAUDE/Core/TestingStandards.md" ]; then DOCS_TO_REFERENCE="$DOCS_TO_REFERENCE- @CLAUDE/Core/TestingStandards.md\n"; fi; \
  if [ -f "CLAUDE/Tools/PHPStan.md" ]; then DOCS_TO_REFERENCE="$DOCS_TO_REFERENCE- @CLAUDE/Tools/PHPStan.md\n"; fi; \
  if [ -f "CLAUDE/Tools/Commands.md" ]; then DOCS_TO_REFERENCE="$DOCS_TO_REFERENCE- @CLAUDE/Tools/Commands.md\n"; fi; \
else \
  echo "✗ No CLAUDE directory found"; \
fi; \
echo "DOCS_TO_REFERENCE: \"$DOCS_TO_REFERENCE\""

## 📋 Task Information Gathering

<Task>
Based on the parsed task name, gather additional information about the plan requirements.
</Task>

Based on the parsed arguments, I need to gather information about your planning task.

<Task>
If no task name was provided, ask for it. Otherwise, ask for additional details about the task.
</Task>

### Task Details Needed:

1. **Task Name**: [Use from parsed arguments or ask if empty]
2. **Task Type**: (feature/bugfix/refactor/optimization/documentation)
3. **Scope**: Brief description of what needs to be done
4. **Key Components**: Main files/modules/systems that will be affected
5. **Dependencies**: External systems, APIs, or libraries involved
6. **Success Criteria**: How will we know the task is complete?

## 🔍 Project Analysis

<Task>
Based on the workflow documentation status and task details, analyze the project structure and gather relevant information.
</Task>

### Checking Existing Plans

!echo "Checking for existing plans"; \
set -e; \
# Determine plan directory based on project structure \
if [ -d "CLAUDE/Plan" ]; then \
  PLAN_DIR="CLAUDE/Plan"; \
elif [ -d "CLAUDE" ]; then \
  PLAN_DIR="CLAUDE/Plan"; \
else \
  PLAN_DIR="plans"; \
fi; \
echo "PLAN_DIR: \"$PLAN_DIR\""; \
# Check if plan already exists \
if [ -n "$FILENAME" ] && [ -f "$PLAN_DIR/$FILENAME.md" ]; then \
  echo "WARNING: Plan already exists at $PLAN_DIR/$FILENAME.md"; \
  echo "Consider updating the existing plan or choosing a different name"; \
fi

## 📝 Plan Generation

<Task>
Now I'll generate the plan using either the project workflow or the embedded generic template.
</Task>

### Generic Planning Workflow Template

<Task>
This is the embedded generic planning workflow that will be used if no project-specific workflow is found.
</Task>

```markdown
# Task Planning and Execution

## Two Modes

We are always in 1 of 2 Modes. 
You are in planning mode by default. Execution mode only when made absolutely explicit 

### Planning Mode

NO CODE CHANGES

We create/update a plan file which should be stored in CLAUDE/Plan/(task-name).md

When we are planning a task, we need to do the following:

* full research of all relevant files/database tables etc
* terse but detailed plan of required actions
* code snippets for particularly relevant items
* check project documentation in CLAUDE folder for anything relevant and ensure we are meeting project standards
* create a simple TODO list at the top of the file
* in planning mode, NO CODE CHANGES

## Execution Mode

Only triggered once given explicit instruction to execute/proceed/implement the plan

When we are executing a plan
* once plan is approved, we are in execution mode.
* Make sure you have read
  * the relevant @CLAUDE/plan/(task-name).md plan file
  * @CLAUDE/PlanWorkflow.md
* Work through the list in the Progress section, 
* update Progress as we go. 
* Make sure tools are being run and issues resolved as we go. 
* Once plan is complete, add ALL DONE

## Task Status Tracking

The following symbols MUST be used to indicate task status in the Progress section:
* `[ ]` - Task not started
* `[⏳]` - Task in progress (currently being worked on)
* `[✓]` - Task completed 100%

As you work through the plan:
1. Mark tasks as `[⏳]` when you begin working on them
2. Mark tasks as `[✓]` ONLY when they are fully completed, tested, and validated
3. Update the plan document after EACH task status change
4. NEVER leave a task as `[⏳]` at the end of an execution session

## Plan Maintenance

* The plan document MUST be kept up to date at all times during execution
* After completing each task, immediately update its status in the plan
* If new tasks are discovered during execution, add them to the Progress section
* If a task needs to be broken down further, update the plan to reflect this
* Add "ALL DONE!" below the ## Progress heading ONLY when all tasks are completed AND static analysis reports no issues
* ALWAYS - stick to editing/updating a single plan file. Do not make new plan files related to the same plan, eg blah-blah-"updated".md 
  * UNLESS - you have been specifically asked to make a new plan
```

### Loading Workflow Template

<Task>
If a project workflow was found, load it. Otherwise, use the embedded generic template above.
</Task>

I'll now create a plan following the discovered workflow structure.

## 🎯 Creating the Plan File

<Task>
Create the plan directory if it doesn't exist and prepare the plan content.
</Task>

!echo "Creating plan directory structure"; \
set -e; \
# Create plan directory if needed \
if [ ! -d "$PLAN_DIR" ]; then \
  mkdir -p "$PLAN_DIR"; \
  echo "✓ Created $PLAN_DIR directory"; \
else \
  echo "✓ Plan directory already exists: $PLAN_DIR"; \
fi

### Plan Template Structure

Based on the workflow (project-specific or generic), I'll create a plan with this structure:

```markdown
# [Task Name] Plan

Ensure all the following have been read:
[Project documentation references]

## Progress

[ ] Research and analyze current implementation
[ ] Document required changes
[ ] Plan implementation approach
[ ] Identify testing requirements
[ ] Create rollback strategy

## Summary

[Brief description of the task goal]

## Details

### Current State Analysis

[Research findings about current implementation]

### Proposed Changes

[Detailed description of what needs to be changed]

### Implementation Approach

[Step-by-step approach to implement the changes]

### Testing Strategy

[How to validate the changes work correctly]

### Rollback Plan

[How to revert changes if needed]
```

### ⚠️ Confirmation Required

I'm about to create a new plan file for: **[task-name]**

The plan will:
- Be created at: `[PLAN_DIR]/[filename].md`
- Follow the two-mode workflow (Planning Mode / Execution Mode)
- Include progress tracking with [ ], [⏳], [✓] symbols
- Reference relevant project documentation
- Contain NO CODE CHANGES (planning mode only)

**Do you want to proceed with creating this plan?** (yes/no)

## ✅ Plan Creation

<Task>
After user confirmation, create the actual plan file with all the necessary content.
</Task>

I'll now create your plan with:
1. Required documentation references
2. Progress tracking section
3. Detailed task breakdown
4. Implementation guidelines
5. All following the planning mode rules (NO CODE CHANGES)

## 📍 Plan Created Successfully

### Location

Your plan has been created at: `[full-path-to-plan]`

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Review the plan**: Open the file and review the proposed approach
2. **Research phase**: The plan includes sections for documenting research findings
3. **Refine as needed**: Add more details based on your research
4. **Stay in planning mode**: Remember, NO CODE CHANGES during planning
5. **Get approval**: When the plan is complete, get approval to enter execution mode

### 💡 Important Reminders

**Planning Mode Rules:**
- Full research of all relevant files/database tables
- Detailed plan of required actions
- Code snippets for particularly relevant items
- Check project documentation for standards
- NO CODE CHANGES

**When Ready for Execution:**
- Ensure plan is complete and approved
- Execution mode must be explicitly requested
- Progress will be tracked using [⏳] and [✓] symbols
- Plan must be kept updated during execution

### 📝 Plan Workflow Summary

```
Planning Mode (Current) → Review & Approval → Execution Mode → Implementation
     ↓                                            ↓
  Research                                    Track Progress
  Document                                    Update Status
  NO CHANGES                                  Make Changes
```

## 🚨 Error Recovery

If something goes wrong:
1. Check if the plan file was partially created
2. Verify write permissions in the target directory
3. Ensure the task name doesn't contain invalid characters
4. Try using a different filename if needed
