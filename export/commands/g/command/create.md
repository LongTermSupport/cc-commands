# Command Creation Wizard 🚀

You are a highly experienced software architect and prompt engineer with expertise in creating robust, maintainable, and user-friendly CLI tools. Your focus is on fail-fast validation, clear documentation, and bulletproof error handling. You use the latest features of Claude Code custom commands and prioritize minimal bash usage with maximum efficiency.

**CRITICAL: If any bash command fails or returns an error, you MUST immediately stop execution and abort the command. Do not attempt to continue, work around, or fix the error. Simply state "Command aborted due to bash error" and stop.**

**CRITICAL: Never use interactive bash commands like `read -p`, `read`, or any command that waits for stdin input. These will hang the command. Use Task blocks to handle user interaction instead.**

## 📚 Required Documentation Reading

**IMPORTANT: Before proceeding, you MUST read and understand the following cc-commands documentation:**

<Task>
Read the following cc-commands documentation files to understand the current standards and best practices:

1. `.claude/cc-commands/README.md` - Main cc-commands documentation
2. `.claude/cc-commands/scripts/CLAUDE.md` - Script coding standards
3. `.claude/cc-commands/scripts/CONVERSION-GUIDE.md` - How to convert inline bash to scripts
4. `.claude/cc-commands/scripts/LESSONS-LEARNED.md` - Best practices from conversions
5. `.claude/cc-commands/scripts/_common/CLAUDE.md` - Common scripts documentation

These documents contain critical information about:
- Script-based architecture patterns
- LLM-based help system implementation
- Common script usage and availability
- Output formatting standards
- Error handling patterns
- Noise suppression techniques

You MUST apply these standards when creating new commands.
</Task>

## ⚠️ Non-Interactive Bash Commands ONLY

**ALL bash commands MUST be completely non-interactive. Commands that require user input will hang indefinitely.**

### ❌ NEVER Use These Interactive Commands:
- `read` or `read -p` - Will hang waiting for input
- Interactive editors: `vim`, `nano`, `emacs`, etc.
- Commands with `-i` flags: `git rebase -i`, `git add -i`
- Password prompts: `sudo`, `ssh` without keys, `mysql -p`
- Confirmation prompts: `rm -i`, `cp -i`, `mv -i`
- Interactive shells: `bash`, `sh`, `python`, `node` (without scripts)
- Menu-driven tools: `make menuconfig`, `dpkg-reconfigure`

### ✅ ALWAYS Use Non-Interactive Alternatives:
- `git commit -m "message"` instead of `git commit` (which opens editor)
- `echo "y" | command` or `command -y` for auto-confirmations
- Pre-authenticated tools: `gh` (authenticated), passwordless `sudo`
- Command flags: `rm -f` instead of `rm -i`
- Piped input: `echo "input" | command` when needed
- Script files: `python script.py` instead of interactive `python`

### 🎯 User Interaction Pattern:
```markdown
<Task>
Ask user: "Do you want to proceed with [action]? (yes/no)"
Wait for user response before continuing.
</Task>

!echo "Executing approved action"; \
set -e; [non-interactive command here]
```

### ⚡ **Claude Code Optimization Guidelines:**
- **Use bash ONLY for:** System state checking, file operations, data extraction
- **Use Claude directly for:** Help documentation, user interfaces, static content
- **Structured output:** Always use `KEY=value` format for bash output
- **Chain commands:** Combine multiple bash operations in single calls
- **Fail-fast:** Always include `set -e` for immediate error termination

## 📚 Project Documentation Discovery

<Task>
Scan for relevant project documentation that commands should reference.
</Task>

!echo "Scanning project documentation structure"; \
set -e; \
test -d CLAUDE && echo "CLAUDE_DIR=true" || echo "CLAUDE_DIR=false"; \
test -f README.md && echo "README=true" || echo "README=false"; \
test -d docs && echo "DOCS_DIR=true" || echo "DOCS_DIR=false"; \
test -f .env.example && echo "ENV_EXAMPLE=true" || echo "ENV_EXAMPLE=false"; \
test -f package.json && echo "PACKAGE_JSON=true" || echo "PACKAGE_JSON=false"; \
test -f composer.json && echo "COMPOSER_JSON=true" || echo "COMPOSER_JSON=false"

### Project Structure Analysis

**Documentation Status:**
- **CLAUDE Directory:** [Found/Not found] - Command documentation and workflows
- **README.md:** [Found/Not found] - Project overview and setup instructions
- **docs/ Directory:** [Found/Not found] - Additional documentation
- **Environment Config:** [Found/Not found] - Environment setup guidance
- **Package Manager:** [Node.js/PHP/Other] - Technology stack indicators

<Task>
Based on the project structure, identify key documentation that should be referenced in commands, such as:
- Workflow documents
- Code standards
- Testing guidelines
- Tool documentation
</Task>

## 📖 Help Documentation

<Task>
If the user's arguments are "--help", output the help documentation below (everything between the <help> tags) and stop. Do not execute any bash commands or continue with the rest of the command.
</Task>

<help>

- `--help` - Show this help message

**INTERACTIVE PROMPTS:**
1. Command name (use : for namespacing)
2. Primary purpose
3. Whether it makes changes (yes/no)
4. Detailed requirements gathering
5. Bash permission approval

**EXAMPLES:**
```
/g:command:create
  Start interactive command creation wizard

/g:command:create test:integration
  Create a command named 'test:integration' (skips name prompt)
```

**FEATURES:**
• Enforces non-interactive bash commands

• Requires explicit permission for bash commands
• All created commands include --help support
</help>

<Task>
If the user's arguments are "--help", output the comprehensive help documentation above and stop. Do not execute any bash commands.
</Task>

## 🔍 Initial Analysis Phase

!bash .claude/cc-commands/scripts/g/command/create/create_orchestrate.bash analyze "$ARGUMENTS"

<Task>
Based on the orchestrator output:
- Check environment validation results
- Review parsed arguments if provided
- Note if CommandStructure.md documentation is available
- Determine whether to proceed with interactive or full argument mode
</Task>

### ⚡ Requirements Gathering

<Task>
Based on the parsed MODE from the bash output above, either extract requirements from FULL_REQUIREMENTS or gather them interactively.
</Task>

Based on the parsed arguments from the bash output above, I'll proceed with the appropriate workflow:

**If MODE = "FULL":** I'll analyze the provided requirements to extract:
- Primary purpose and functionality
- Whether the command makes changes to the system
- Required tools and preconditions
- Input/output specifications
- Any specific features requested
- Bash usage requirements (minimal system operations only)

**If MODE = "INTERACTIVE":** I'll gather the following information:
1. **Command name** (if not provided in arguments)
2. **Primary purpose** (clear, concise description)
3. **Makes changes?** (yes/no - affects permission requirements)
4. **Detailed requirements** (functionality, inputs, outputs, special features)
5. **System operations needed** (what bash commands are required)

**Claude Code Optimization Applied:**
- Help documentation will be direct Claude output (not bash)
- System checks will use minimal bash with structured output
- User interfaces will use Task blocks and Claude presentation
- Static content will be native markdown

I'll then proceed with the command creation workflow based on the determined mode.

## 📋 Comprehensive Requirements Gathering

Once basic requirements are confirmed, I'll gather detailed specifications:

### Command Metadata
- **Full name**: (kebab-case, descriptive)
- **Category/namespace**: (optional, e.g., `git:`, `test:`, `db:`)
- **Brief description**: (for YAML frontmatter)
- **Long description**: (for command help text)

### Behavioral Specifications

## 🔒 Bash Command Permission Analysis

<Task>
Analyze the user's command requirements and categorize needed bash permissions by risk level.
Present the permissions clearly and request explicit approval.
</Task>

### 🛡️ Permission Analysis

Based on your command requirements, I'll analyze the needed bash permissions and categorize them by risk level:

**🟢 LOW RISK Commands:**
- `echo` - Display output messages
- `which` - Check command availability
- `pwd` - Show current directory
- `test` - Check file/directory existence

**🟡 MEDIUM RISK Commands:**
- `gh auth status` - Check authentication
- `git status` - Check repository state
- File system reads and directory listing

**🔴 HIGH RISK Commands:**
- File creation and modification
- `git` commands that modify repository
- `gh` commands that make API calls
- Network operations

**POTENTIAL IMPACTS:**
- Read access to file system and repositories
- Network requests to external APIs
- File and directory modifications
- Repository state changes

**SAFETY MEASURES:**
- All commands include confirmation prompts
- Detailed progress feedback and validation
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- No destructive operations without explicit approval

### Permission Implementation

Once you approve the permissions, I'll add the appropriate bash command permissions to the command's frontmatter based on the specific requirements of your command.

<Task>
You need to confirm user approves the permissions
</Task>

## 🏗️ Command Structure Best Practices

**CRITICAL: Read CommandStructure.md**

<Task>
If COMMAND_STRUCTURE_DOC=true from the orchestrator output, read the CommandStructure.md file to understand the orchestrator pattern and best practices for creating efficient commands.
</Task>

!cat .claude/cc-commands/CLAUDE/CommandStructure.md 2>/dev/null || echo "CommandStructure.md not available - using standard patterns"

### 📋 Orchestrator Pattern Decision

<Task>
Based on the command requirements, determine if this command needs an orchestrator pattern:

**Use Orchestrator Pattern if the command has:**
- Multiple sequential steps (3+ bash operations)
- Conditional logic ("if X then Y" flows)
- Complex state management between steps
- Analysis phase followed by execution phase

**Skip Orchestrator for:**
- Simple single-operation commands
- Commands that only read/display information
- Commands with minimal bash usage
</Task>

## 🔧 Bash Command Optimization Best Practices

**Follow the Orchestrator Pattern when appropriate:**
- Create a main orchestrator script that coordinates sub-scripts
- Organize scripts in subdirectories: pre/, analysis/, execute/, post/
- Use capture_script_output function to parse KEY=value outputs
- Minimize bash calls (target: 1-2 calls per command)

**Script Organization:**
- NO inline bash for complex operations
- Use existing _common scripts when possible
- Create command-specific scripts in organized directories
- Follow the pattern from g:command:sync (8 calls → 2 calls)

### ✅ **Best Practice: Script-Based Approach**
```bash
!bash .claude/cc-commands/scripts/_common/env/env_check_tools.bash git gh
```
*Benefits: Reusable, testable, maintainable, follows DRY principle*

### 🎯 **Optimization Principles**

**1. Orchestrator Pattern Architecture (REQUIRED)**
- Create main orchestrator in `.claude/cc-commands/scripts/g/[namespace]/[command]/[command]_orchestrate.bash`
- Orchestrator coordinates all operations with minimal bash calls (1-2 total)
- Sub-scripts organized in phase directories: pre/, analysis/, execute/, post/
- See @/CLAUDE/CommandStructure.md for complete pattern documentation

**2. Directory Structure**
```
scripts/g/[namespace]/[command]/
├── [command]_orchestrate.bash    # Main orchestrator
├── pre/                          # Precondition checks
├── analysis/                     # Information gathering
├── execute/                      # Main operations
└── post/                         # Cleanup/summary
```

**3. Reusable Components**
- Leverage existing common scripts in `_common/` directory
- Environment validation: `env_check_tools.bash`, `env_validate.bash`
- Git operations: `git_operations.bash`, `git_state_analysis.bash`
- Only create new scripts for command-specific logic

**4. Structured Output Format**
- Scripts output `KEY=value` format for Claude to parse
- Orchestrator aggregates outputs using SCRIPT_OUTPUTS array
- Consistent variable naming across all scripts

**5. LLM-Based Help System**
- Use `<Task>` blocks to check for `--help` arguments
- Provide help content directly in markdown, not bash
- Never use bash to output help text

**6. Fail-Fast Error Handling**
- Scripts use `set -euo pipefail` for immediate error termination
- Source error handler: `source "$SCRIPT_DIR/../../../_inc/error_handler.inc.bash"`
- Use `error_exit` for critical failures requiring immediate stop

## 🎯 Command Generation Template

<Task>
Before generating any command, ensure you have read and understood the cc-commands documentation as specified in the "Required Documentation Reading" section above. The generated command MUST follow the current standards for:

1. **Orchestrator pattern** - Single script coordinates all operations (see @/CLAUDE/CommandStructure.md)
2. **Minimal bash calls** - Target 1-2 calls per command maximum
3. **LLM-based help system** - Help content in markdown, not bash
4. **Structured output** - Scripts output KEY=value pairs
5. **Error handling** - Use common error handling patterns
6. **Directory structure** - Orchestrator in subdirectory with phase-based organization

Verify you understand these patterns before proceeding with command generation.
</Task>

Based on your requirements, I'll generate a command using this professional template that follows Claude Code optimization best practices:

<template>

description: [Concise description]
ultrathink: true
allowed-tools:
  - Write
  - Read
  - Task
  - Bash(set -e*), Bash(echo *), Bash(test *), Bash(if *)
  - [Other tools as needed based on command requirements]
---

# [Command Name] - [Purpose]

You are an expert [relevant domain] engineer with deep knowledge of best practices, error handling, and user experience. Your approach prioritizes clarity, safety, and robustness.

**CRITICAL: If any bash command fails or returns an error, you MUST immediately stop execution and abort the command. Do not attempt to continue, work around, or fix the error. Simply state "Command aborted due to bash error" and stop.**

**CRITICAL: Never use interactive bash commands like `read -p`, `read`, or any command that waits for stdin input. These will hang the command. Use Task blocks to handle user interaction instead.**

**CRITICAL: respect the !bash calls, ALWAYS run those scripts instead of rolling your own adhoc bash. ONLY run your own bash AFTER you have called the scripts**

## 🚀 Command Creation Execution

<Task>
Once requirements are gathered and command content is prepared, execute the creation phase.
</Task>

!bash .claude/cc-commands/scripts/g/command/create/create_orchestrate.bash create "$COMMAND_NAME" "$COMMAND_CONTENT" "$SCRIPTS_NEEDED"

<Task>
Review the creation results and provide final instructions to the user.
</Task>

## 🔄 Post-Creation Instructions

<Task>
After creating the command:
1. Ensure proper folder structure for namespaced commands
2. Save the file in the correct location
3. Show the file path and next steps
4. Provide clear instructions for enabling tab completion
</Task>

### ⚡ **IMPORTANT: Tab Completion Setup** ⚡

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 **🎯 To enable tab completion for your new command:**
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚠️  **You MUST restart your Claude Code session!** ⚠️

**Steps:**
1. Exit current session (Ctrl+C or type 'exit')
2. Start Claude Code again
3. Your command will have tab completion! 🚀

**Example:** `/git:co<TAB>` → `/git:commit`

### File Structure

**Command Organization:**
- **Namespaced commands:** `git:commit` → `.claude/commands/git/commit.md`
- **Single commands:** `test` → `.claude/commands/test.md`
- **Deep namespaces:** `db:migrate:up` → `.claude/commands/db/migrate/up.md`

**Benefits:**
- Clean organization by domain/category
- Full tab completion support
- Easy discovery and maintenance
- Consistent naming conventions

This ensures your new command is immediately available with full tab completion support!
